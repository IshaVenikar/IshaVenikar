### Hi, I'm Isha!

I'm a Full-stack TypeScript Developer who enjoys crafting clean, premium user experiences — both on the front-end and behind the scenes.  

- 🛠️ Experienced with React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, TypeORM, and UI libraries like MUI and Chakra UI
- 🎨 Currently learning UI/UX to better understand design systems and interaction patterns
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on meaningful full-stack projects that make a difference

Clean code is my priority — I aim to leave any codebase I touch better than I found it.
